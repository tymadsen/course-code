HW 1

1. Write a short C function named IsLeapYear()
	int IsLeapYear(int year){
		return (!(year%400) || (!(year%4) && year%100));
	}

2. By inspection, what value do you expect result to have after the assignment? Add what you need to compile and run this code and to output the value of result after the assignment (use the compiler of your choice). Does result actually end up with the value you expected? Explain why result is assigned this value.

	int main(){
		int x = 10;
		int y = 3;
		float result;
		result = x / y;
		printf("result: %.2f", result);
		return 0;
	}
	/*
	It appears that the result should be 3.333 but after closer examination or running the code it ends up being 
	3.00 because the division if two integers results in an integer value. Thus the float is assigned the value 3, 
	and not 3.333.

3. t2 = ((t1 << 8) & 0xFF000000) | (~(t1 >> 8) & 0xFF0000) | ((t1 << 8) & 0xFF00) | ((t1 >> 8) & 0xFF);

4.
    a. x + y * z	=> x + (y * z)		= 2
    b. x == 0 && y != 4 => (x == 0) && (y != 4)	= 1 
    c. y < x < z	=> (y < x) < z		= 1
    d. y+-z	        => y + (-z)		= -1
    e. !z||y		=> (!z)||y		= 1
    f. y ? x : z	=> y ? x : z		= 0
    g. x - y < z	=> (x - y) < z		= 1
    h. x = 0 || z <= y	=> (x = 0) || (z <= y)	= 0, x = 0
    i. z & 3 == 2	=> z & (3 == 2)		= 0
