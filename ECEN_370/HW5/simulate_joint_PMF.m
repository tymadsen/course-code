% Make sure that you have this file in your working directory when you
% attempt to do the MATLAB problem for homework 4.
%
% This function simulates outcomes form a joint PMF for a simple XY,
% starting with a matrix that in its rows gives values for X and in its
% columns gives values for Y. So at any (X,Y) you have the joint
% probability of that point. To simulate this, a uniform random variable is
% used to then select which of the (X,Y) points according to the relative
% probability of each point.
