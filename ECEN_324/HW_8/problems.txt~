HW # 8

6.25:
The file is made up of 4000, 512-byte logical blocks.
	Tavg seek = 4ms
	Tmax rotation = 1/15,000RPM * 60 sec/min * 1000 ms/sec = 4ms
	Tavg rotation = Tmax/2 = 2ms
A) Best case: The file consistsIn the the best case, block will be read one after the other without moving the head. It takes 4 rotations (1000 sections per rotations) of the disk to read all 4000 blocks.

Total time = Tavg seek + Tavg rotation + 2*Tmax rotation = 4 + 2 + 8 = 14ms

B) Random case: Blocks are mapped randomly, so each of the 4000 blocks takes Tavg seek + Tavg rotation ms.

Total time = (Tavg seek + Tavg rotation)*4000 = (4 + 2)*4000 = 24,000ms (24 secconds)
